Enhance the existing Warehouse Management System (WMS) UI prototype.
Do NOT change the tech stack or project structure.
Focus only on improving features, depth, and UX maturity.

------------------------------------
1. EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY (IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------
Add Export buttons (CSV & Excel) in all operationally relevant areas.

Inventory Module:
- SKU List: Export SKU master with quantities and locations
- Inventory Storage View: Export location-wise stock
- Stock Ageing: Export ageing report

Order Module:
- Orders List: Export filtered orders
- Picklist: Export picklist for warehouse staff
- Manifest / Challan: Export shipment data

Storage Racks:
- Rack Occupancy: Export utilization report
- Stock Allocation: Export rack-wise allocation

Rules:
- Export button should be placed at the top-right of tables
- Export must respect applied filters
- Use realistic warehouse column names

------------------------------------
2. DASHBOARD – ADD SERIOUS ANALYTICS
------------------------------------
Upgrade dashboard from basic overview to decision-making analytics.

Add KPI Cards:
- Order Fulfillment Rate (%)
- Average Pick Time
- Average Pack Time
- SLA Breach %
- Low Stock SKUs
- Dead / Slow Moving Stock Value
- Rack Utilization %

Add Charts:
- Orders by Status (stacked bar)
- Orders by Hour (warehouse productivity)
- Inventory Ageing Buckets (0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 90+)
- Top 10 SKUs by Volume
- Rack Occupancy Heatmap

Dashboard must feel operational and management-ready, not decorative.

------------------------------------
3. STOCK ALLOCATION – MAKE IT WAREHOUSE-GRADE
------------------------------------
The current stock allocation form is too basic.
Redesign it to reflect real warehouse operations.

Replace simple form with a detailed workflow:

Section 1: SKU Selection
- Searchable SKU selector
- Auto-display SKU details (dimensions, weight, handling type)

Section 2: Smart Rack Suggestions
Table showing:
- Rack
- Zone
- Available Capacity
- Distance to Packing Area
- FIFO Match
- Recommended (badge)

Section 3: Allocation Builder
- Allow splitting quantity across multiple racks
- Show max capacity per rack
- Inline validation and overfill warnings

Section 4: Allocation Rules
Checkboxes:
- Enforce FIFO
- Avoid mixed SKUs
- Prioritize nearest rack
- Allow overflow racks

Section 5: Allocation Summary
- Total quantity allocated
- Space utilization %
- Estimated picking impact

This page must look operational, data-heavy, and realistic.

------------------------------------
4. OVERALL UI MATURITY (REMOVE CHILDISH FEEL)
------------------------------------
Improve UX and visual seriousness across all modules:

- Use neutral enterprise colors (grey, slate, blue)
- Reduce excessive spacing; increase table density
- Use badges instead of plain text for statuses
- Filters must appear above all tables
- Every page should feel task-oriented, not decorative

The final UI should look suitable for a real warehouse client demo.
